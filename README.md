# About Library: Owl_attributeClass

This is a library specificly used to handle stats. Instead of having multiple variables storing data for stats under the /mob tree or any other 
tree related to NPC's or players etc. This library handles stats as it's own object, which is objects you can add to a list called `stats` in this instance.

In this example, stats is a list which looks something like this:

`stats["strength","magic","agility","mana","health"]`
`"strength" = /attribute/new()`
